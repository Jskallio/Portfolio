Here is some links to the videos of my android projects:

1: Quadruped robot with inverse kinematics coded into it.
The lower part was downloaded from Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1009659
The train model and coding was done by me.
The inverse kinematics model has been coded into arduino itself and to control it I use small Unity3d program that sends location data for the tips of the legs.

2: 10x10 LED-screen
Led screen made by using 100 SK6812.
Communication with the screen has been done using ESP32-development boards wifi feature and a small unity program I coded myself.
